.  MySQL - This tool was used to create a database (Kulgar_DB) and query the data set while providing possible solutions to the management
.  DB Browser
. MS Excel (Csv) - This tool was used to save, clean and import the data into Mysql Database

#  Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action;

. Create a database called Kulgar_DB
. Import the Kms SQL case study Csv file and Order Status file

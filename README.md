  # Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action;

Data loading, inspection, handling missing variables, data cleaning and formatting.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
This involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;

What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
Show insights on ratings based on gender
Analyse the company‚Äôs salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management

# Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic line of codes or used during analysis;

The first thing i did was to filter the gender and replace the name without gender with null on my Excel Sheet.
I took out the employers without salary.
I also took out the names without department.
I created another column and merged the employee data with the bonus rules. 
I calculated the amount to be paid to each employee ( salary inclusive of bonus)
I visualize my data using a Pie Chart and this included the total amount to be paid out per region.

# REPORTS

Gender Distribution of Palmora Group
FEMALE - 441
MALE - 465
NULL - 40

. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
‚óè Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
From the analysis Palmora group still pays some employees a minimum of $90,000

Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
‚óè How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 ‚Äì $20,000, $20,000 ‚Äì $30,000,
Greater then $120,000 - 97 employees
$110,000 to $120,000- 105 employees
$100,000 to $110,000 - 90 employees
$80,000 to $90,000 - 108 employees
$70,000 to $80,000 - 117 employees
$60,000 to $70,000 - 99 employees
$50,000 to $60,000 - 96 employees
